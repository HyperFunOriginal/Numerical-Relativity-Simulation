# Numerical Relativity with Modified ADM-BSSN Formulation of the E.F.E.s


This project relies heavily on GPU performance. It is not optimised and requires extremely powerful GPUs to execute at reasonable resolutions. 
Further documentation and procedure can be found as part of a PDF included in this project source.
